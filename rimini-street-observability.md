This JD is **very different from the previous SDET one** — this is a **pure Observability / SRE / Platform Engineering role**.

👉 In simple terms:
You are responsible for **“seeing everything happening inside a system”** — logs, metrics, traces, performance, failures.

* Latency, failures, retries

👉 You should understand:

* Where failures happen
* How requests flow across services

👉 Questions:

* How do you trace a request across services?
* What is service dependency mapping?

---

## ✅ C. Monitoring & Alerting (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Level expected: Strong**

### Must know:

* Prometheus alerting
* Alert fatigue vs signal quality
* SLI / SLO / Error budgets

👉 You should be able to:

* Design alerts that are useful
* Avoid noise

👉 Questions:

* What is SLO?
* What is error budget?
* How do you reduce alert noise?

---

## ✅ D. Logging (IMPORTANT)

**Level expected: Strong**

### Must know:

* Structured logging
* Centralized logging systems

### Tools:

* ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* Loki

👉 Questions:

* Why structured logging?
* How do you search logs efficiently?

---

## ✅ E. Programming (IMPORTANT)

**Level expected: Medium to Strong**

### Languages:

* Python / Java / Go

### Use cases:

* Instrumentation
* Writing monitoring tools

👉 Questions:

* How do you instrument an application?
* What is auto vs manual instrumentation?

---

## ✅ F. Kubernetes / Cloud (PREFERRED but important)

**Level expected: Medium**

### Must know:

* Basics of Kubernetes
* Pods, services, deployments

👉 Bonus:

* Service mesh (Istio)

👉 Questions:

* How do you monitor Kubernetes?
* What metrics matter in K8s?

---

## ✅ G. CI/CD Integration (IMPORTANT)

**Level expected: Medium**

### Must know:

* Observability in pipelines
* Deployment tracking

👉 Questions:

* How do you track deployment issues?
* How do you correlate logs with releases?

---

## ✅ H. AI Observability (BONUS but trending)

**Level expected: Basic awareness**

### Must know:

* LLM monitoring basics
* Model performance tracking

👉 Questions:

* How would you monitor AI system performance?

---

# 🧪 3. What YOU should brush up more (priority order)

### 🔥 Top Priority:

1. **OpenTelemetry (MUST learn properly)**
2. **Prometheus + Grafana**
3. **Distributed tracing (Jaeger)**

---

### ⚡ Medium Priority:

4. SLI / SLO concepts
5. Logging systems (ELK / Loki)
6. Microservices understanding

---

### 👍 Bonus:

7. Kubernetes observability
8. AI/LLM monitoring basics

---

# 🧩 4. Hidden expectations (VERY IMPORTANT)

From JD language:

👉 They expect you to:

* Debug **production issues**
* Work on **large-scale distributed systems**
* Build **end-to-end visibility**

### Example:

Not just:
❌ “CPU is high”

But:
✅ “Which service → which request → which DB call → causing latency”

---

# 🎯 5. Sample Interview Questions (realistic)

## Observability:

* Explain OpenTelemetry architecture
* How do traces work across microservices?
* Metrics vs logs vs traces?

---

## Scenario-based:

* System is slow → how do you debug?
* API latency increased → steps?
* No logs → how will you troubleshoot?

---

## Alerting:

* How do you design alerts?
* What is alert fatigue?

---

## SRE concepts:

* What is SLO?
* What is error budget?

---

## Hands-on:

* Write PromQL query (basic)
* Design dashboard for system health

---

# ⚠️ 6. Reality Check (important for you)

Compared to your previous JD (SDET):

| Area                 | SDET Role | Observability Role |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Automation           | Heavy     | Light              |
| Data Testing         | Heavy     | Minimal            |
| Monitoring           | Low       | VERY HIGH          |
| System Design        | Medium    | HIGH               |
| Production Debugging | Medium    | VERY HIGH          |

---

# 📌 7. Final Summary (Simple)

👉 To crack this role, you need:

* Strong **Observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry)** ⭐
* Deep understanding of **distributed systems**
* Good **debugging mindset (production issues)**
* Basics of **Kubernetes + logging systems**

---

# 🚀 If I were you (practical advice)

Since you mentioned earlier you like **observability challenges**, this role is actually a **perfect match direction** — but:

👉 You need to **shift from testing mindset → system thinking mindset**
